0,__label__2,simple durable fun game for all ages this is an awesome game! almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is easy to learn and quick to play you can't play just once! the twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent the first person to make tic-tac-toe wins but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! my 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when i'm trying to win! excellent beginning critical thinking game grandparents loved playing it with the kids too
1,__label__2,review of kelly club for toddlers for the price of 799 this pc game is well worth it great graphics colorful and lots to do! my four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade

4,__label__1,long and boring i've read this book with much expectation it was very boring all through out the book
5,__label__1,dont like it this product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so i spent 10 and havent worn then i wouldnt buy this product again dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use
6,__label__2,one of the last in the series to collect ! the magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that victoria magazine has come to represent i have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day

8,__label__1,don't take the chance - get the se branded cable if you purchase this data cable you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works as directed i downloaded all of the files from the se site 70mb on dial up! and then downloaded all of the user guides everything seemed to install ok but nothing would make my phone be recognized after that i scoured the se site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem after 2 full days of beating my head against the wall i finally threw the cable and the useless cd that came with it in the trashif i had used my brain i would have paid the extra  for a se branded cable and software and the support that comes along with that i now have the real deal se data cable and software and guess what? yep installation was a breeze and it works beautifully you really do get what you pay for
9,__label__1,waste of money! like many of the barbie cd roms the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters ages 5  7 like the barbie movies and other cd roms the graphics are poorly done
10,__label__2,works great i bought this item to connect to a strobe light unit functions well not sure that it has all the range claimed but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this just too many variables i can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage at least 40' going thru two buildings now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know
11,__label__1,has no range i suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device lamp etc plugged into this control it might work maybe but i had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit and it was completely unreliablei'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product
12,__label__2,wish i had gotten this sooner! ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want under my desk shelf etc
13,__label__1,three days of use and it broke very disappointed in this product it worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated it was very inexpensive so i did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction
14,__label__2,this is the all time best book! this is the all time best book she mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire who knows well anyway i like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush ps i think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world
15,__label__2,mary ash can't believe i have never reviewed this book before first read this back when i was 13 like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him
16,__label__2,tha bomb of a book!! lj smith is the best author in the whole world i read this book a year ago but i can't stop reading it it is beyond sweet i love ashthe entire night world seris is the bomb i read mostly everyone of lj smiths book and they all are awesome i think ash and mary lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates i loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't there should be real guys like ashquinnjuliundamongabriel and i can go on forever i think everyone should read at least one lj smith book if you do you'll be hooked on them for lifelike i am lj smith is the best!!!!
17,__label__2,this book was a great book that i have read many times! this book was so great! i loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart i just hope that there is a follow up on this story because i want to know if mary-lynette and ash get together
18,__label__2,they'd watch it nonstop if i'd let them apart from it arriving broken the first time my kids are loving this dvd which i alternate with the other i purchased to keep my own sanity this dvd has created a thomas fan out of my 3 12 yr old daughter as well
19,__label__1,not as expected my children get easily bored with this video i thought it was several episodes of thomas but it has a lot of just children and parents talking about thomas and all it doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking this was my first thomas video purchasehopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
20,__label__2,wonderful i went online for information about dockers khaki pants the size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores i was very impressed with the selection i had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length the delivery was quick especially during christmas and i really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose
21,__label__1,doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants so when it was shipped i was charged 9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks laterwill not buy from amazon vendors again
22,__label__2,book of chance i had just finished reading 'the food of love' by anthony capella since i had nothing to do but read mind you reading is one of my favorite pastimesi had recently bought a series of books the food of love was just one of the books i just picked up so i can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at waterstones in london british's equivalent of barnesnoble i wasn't really interested but it was one of the more interesting options i had well i'm glad i made the right choice! i started reading it last night and i haven't put it down sinceif you love food and a little romance which i am both fond of it's an excellent book to read mr capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more this book took me by surprise and i'm sure you would not be disappointed
23,__label__1,light reading light in substance a clichéd storyline based on the classic cyrano de bergerac this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for italian culture and cuisine but little experience in developing a story i can understand bruno and his passion for cooking but have no clue as to his passion for laura it seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde american how exotic her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history and she enjoys bruno's cooking with a passion that's about it and tomasso he's just the cliché for any over-sexed mediterranean male who encounters foreign femalesit's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away that being said i will however check out this author's more recent novels he does seem to have a way with technical details hopefully his storytelling has caught up
24,__label__2,weib forever! this is a great cd!! i love weib kreuz!! the anime is awsome! its bout 4 guys hhhooottt who work at a flower shop but at night they are the white hunters or byce as in the anime they are assasins that hunt the tomorrow of bad guys the bad guys the police cant get  like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason from a strange gas substance that w instant contact ingulfs any object but i couldnt resist its also an emotional anime at times! i think this is a cd and anime any anime fan should see
25,__label__1,great book--unacceptable condition i was looking forward to receiving this book as i was going to new orleans to antoine's restaurant i read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy this book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that i could not read it without my eyes watering i sent it back at my own expense and to date i have not had a refund
26,__label__2,real html for people who build sites for a living this book is simply great! if you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize html and present its syntax willy-nilly this book is the only book i've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup it explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook html with other technologies without trying to teach cgi css etc at the same time the only thing i wish is that this guy would write a javascript or dhtml book i'd buy that right away
27,__label__2,marriage has its good and bad moments this is a tear-jerker mixed with humor a lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times too i watch this movie often as i am a hopeless romantic and i thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing hindi style  pop rock mix plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts it ends the way a typical relationship of this type would but that's not exactly a bad thing in this case i recommend it to everyone
28,__label__2,amazing love itvery touchit's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
